  # conda-build for some inane reason, effectively puts C:\cygwin\bin at the
  # front of the PATH, ahead of everything else, regardless. See
  # https://github.com/conda/conda-build/blob/master/conda_build/external.py#L19
  # On Appveyor, the version of git installed there doesn't work
  # outside of the cygwin envronment, so despite a perfectly good version of
  # git being installed somewhere else (git for windows, which works properly),
  # conda-build will always choose to use the broken one. The only way I could
  # think of to fix this is just to delete the broken one, so that it never gets
  # found by conda-build. Or someone could fix conda-build.
